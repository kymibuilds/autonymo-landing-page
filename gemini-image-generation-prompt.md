# Autonymo Homepage — Image Generation Prompt for Gemini

> **Purpose:** Generate a complete set of visually cohesive, theme-matching images for the Autonymo homepage. All images must feel like they belong to the same design system and brand world.

---

## Brand Context

**Autonymo** is a premium AI Studio that builds custom AI operating systems for real estate, healthcare, and lead generation teams. The brand communicates: technically capable but not intimidating, modern but not trendy, confident but not arrogant.

### Color Palette (STRICT — all images must use these colors)

| Color         | Hex         | Role                                      |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Charcoal      | `#1A1A1A`   | Primary dark, headlines, dark sections     |
| Warm Cream    | `#F5F0EB`   | Primary background of the website          |
| Accent Blue   | `#2D7FF9`   | Accent highlights, interactive elements    |
| White         | `#FFFFFF`   | Card surfaces, UI elements                 |
| Sand          | `#E8E2DA`   | Borders, subtle fills, dividers            |
| Warm Gray     | `#A39E97`   | Captions, labels, secondary elements       |
| Text Muted    | `#6B6560`   | Body text color                            |
| Light Gray    | `#F9F7F5`   | Alternate subtle backgrounds               |

### Visual Style Rules

- **Warm, premium, minimalist** aesthetic — NOT cold/techy/corporate
- Clean whitespace, generous padding, softly rounded corners (10–14px radius)
- Subtle depth through soft shadows and layering — no harsh drop shadows
- Muted, desaturated tones with strategic blue accent pops
- No gradients except on the logo (gradient reserved: `#0066FF` → `#00B4FF`)
- No stock-photo-style imagery of people smiling at laptops
- Prefer abstract/conceptual illustrations, clean UI mockups, and isometric-style product visuals
- Typography in images should use geometric sans-serif fonts resembling **Plus Jakarta Sans** (bold headlines) and **DM Sans** (body text)

## Image Specifications

All images should be generated at **2x resolution** for retina displays. Use PNG format with transparency where noted.

---

## Section 1: Hero Section

### Image 1A — Hero Background Visual (Optional subtle texture/pattern)

- **Dimensions:** 1920×1080px
- **Description:** A very subtle, abstract background pattern or texture that sits behind the hero text. Think: soft particle field, gentle geometric grid, or organic flowing lines.
- **Color palette:** Warm cream (`#F5F0EB`) as the dominant base with very faint sand (`#E8E2DA`) lines/shapes at 10–20% opacity. Optionally, a few tiny blue (`#2D7FF9`) dots at 5–10% opacity scattered sparsely.
- **Mood:** Calm, sophisticated, barely-there. This is NOT a hero image — it's a background texture that doesn't compete with text.
- **Important:** Must be seamless/tileable or fade to cream at edges. The website already has a canvas particle animation, so this should complement, not replace that effect.

---

## Section 2: Featured Platform Cards (3 images)

Each card has a `4:3 aspect ratio` placeholder area at the bottom. These images represent abstract product UI previews.

### Image 2A — Health Services OS Card Visual

- **Dimensions:** 800×600px
- **Description:** A clean, abstract representation of a healthcare AI dashboard. Show a stylized UI with: a patient queue/schedule sidebar, an AI-assisted diagnostics panel with simple chart/waveform, and a status indicator. NOT a real screenshot — a simplified, illustrative mock.
- **Color palette:** Background of sand/cream (`#E8E2DA` at 30% opacity), white card surfaces (`#FFFFFF`), thin sand borders, small accent blue highlight on one active element. Tiny charcoal text placeholders (lines/blocks, NOT real text).
- **Style:** Flat, minimal, slightly isometric perspective. Window chrome with 3 small dots (like macOS) in top-left. Frosted glass/glassmorphism effect on overlapping panels.
- **Mood:** Clean, trustworthy, medical-grade precision.

### Image 2B — Real Estate OS Card Visual

- **Dimensions:** 800×600px
- **Description:** A clean, abstract representation of a real estate AI dashboard. Show a stylized UI with: a property listing grid, an AI valuation indicator (simple bar or number), and a small map placeholder. A lead pipeline or funnel visual element.
- **Color palette:** Background of light gray (`#F9F7F5`), white card surfaces, thin sand borders, accent blue on one highlighted property card or metric.
- **Style:** Same flat/minimal style as 2A for consistency. Window chrome dots in top-left. Layered cards with subtle depth.
- **Mood:** Professional, data-driven, modern real estate tech.

### Image 2C — Custom Solutions Card Visual

- **Dimensions:** 800×600px
- **Description:** A clean, abstract representation of a modular workflow builder or integration dashboard. Show: connected nodes/blocks (workflow automation), an API/integration panel, and modular building blocks being assembled.
- **Color palette:** Background of sand/cream (`#E8E2DA` at 20% opacity), white modules/blocks, thin sand borders, accent blue connection lines between nodes.
- **Style:** Same flat/minimal style as 2A and 2B. Nodes connected by thin lines or arrows. Modular, Lego-like feel.
- **Mood:** Flexible, powerful, customizable.

---

## Section 3: AI Solutions Cards (4 images)

Each card has a `16:8 aspect ratio` (wide/short) placeholder area at the bottom. These are compact visual representations of each capability.

### Image 3A — Automation Agents Visual

- **Dimensions:** 800×400px
- **Description:** A simplified workflow automation diagram. 3–4 rounded rectangle nodes connected by thin lines/arrows in a left-to-right flow. First node could represent "trigger," middle nodes "process," last node "output." Small icons or dots inside each node.
- **Color palette:** Sand/cream background (`#E8E2DA` at 20%), white nodes with sand borders, thin charcoal connecting lines at 10% opacity. One node highlighted with accent blue border or fill.
- **Style:** Clean, diagrammatic, flat. Frosted glass bottom bar overlay.
- **Mood:** Systematic, efficient, automated.

### Image 3B — AI Voice Agent Visual

- **Dimensions:** 800×400px
- **Description:** An abstract audio/voice waveform visualization. Vertical bars of varying heights arranged in a sound-wave pattern (5–9 bars). A small phone or microphone icon element. Optionally, a speech bubble or conversation thread hint.
- **Color palette:** Sand/cream background, charcoal bars at 10% opacity with varying heights. One accent blue bar or a blue phone icon badge in corner. Frosted glass elements.
- **Style:** Minimal, rhythmic, clean. The voice bars should feel like a calm, professional audio visualization — NOT a loud music equalizer.
- **Mood:** Conversational, intelligent, responsive.

### Image 3C — Lead Qualification Visual

- **Dimensions:** 800×400px
- **Description:** An abstract lead pipeline or scoring interface. Stacked horizontal rows/items (like a list), each with a small colored dot (qualification status) and placeholder text blocks. Maybe a subtle funnel shape or priority indicator.
- **Color palette:** Light gray background (`#F9F7F5`), white list items with sand borders, small accent blue dot on the top/highest-priority item. Charcoal placeholder text blocks at 5% opacity.
- **Style:** Clean list/table layout, flat, with subtle shadow layering. Slight offset/translate on second row for depth.
- **Mood:** Organized, data-rich, prioritized.

### Image 3D — Data & Analytics Visual

- **Dimensions:** 800×400px
- **Description:** An abstract analytics dashboard snippet. A simple bar chart (4–5 bars) with varying heights, plus a small metric card or KPI badge in the corner. Clean grid lines in background.
- **Color palette:** Sand/cream background, charcoal bars at 5–10% opacity (alternating slightly). One accent element (a metric badge) in white with subtle shadow. Faint grid lines in sand.
- **Style:** Data visualization, minimal, flat. Rounded bar tops.
- **Mood:** Insightful, data-driven, clear.

## Section 4: How It Works Steps (Optional — 5 images)

The "How It Works" section has 5 step cards. Currently they have minimal decorative progress bars. If replacing with images, each should be a small, abstract icon-style illustration.

### Images 4A–4E — Step Illustrations

- **Dimensions:** 400×200px each
- **Description (per step):**
  1. **Introductory Call** — Two abstract speech bubbles or a handshake icon composed of simple geometric shapes. A phone receiver or video call frame.
  2. **Consulting Phase** — A magnifying glass over a simplified document or process flowchart. Analysis/discovery motif.
  3. **Development** — Interlocking gears, code brackets `< />`, or building blocks being stacked. Construction/building motif.
  4. **Testing & Launch** — A checkmark inside a shield or a rocket in a minimal line-art style. Quality assurance + launch.
  5. **Follow-Up & Learning** — A graduation cap, upward trend line, or a book/document with a sparkle. Growth/learning motif.

- **Color palette:** All on cream/transparent background. Primary shapes in sand (`#E8E2DA`) and warm gray (`#A39E97`). One accent element per illustration in blue (`#2D7FF9`) at 40% opacity.
- **Style:** Geometric, line-art, flat illustration. Consistent stroke width (2–3px). NO realistic/detailed illustrations — keep them simple and diagrammatic.
- **Mood:** Progressive, methodical, professional.

---

## Section 5: Final CTA Section

### Image 5A — CTA Background Texture (Optional)

- **Dimensions:** 1200×600px
- **Description:** A very subtle dark background texture or pattern for the charcoal CTA section. Think: faint geometric grid, subtle topographic lines, or a soft radial gradient from center.
- **Color palette:** Charcoal base (`#1A1A1A`) with very faint lighter charcoal lines/shapes (`#262626` to `#333333`). Optionally, a very subtle blue glow (`#2D7FF9`) at 5% opacity in the center.
- **Style:** Dark, sophisticated, barely visible texture. Must not compete with white text overlay.
- **Mood:** Premium, confident, inviting.

---

## Global Consistency Rules

1. **All images must feel like they come from the same design system.** Same line weights, same corner radii, same color usage ratios, same level of abstraction.
2. **No photography, no photorealism.** Everything should be flat illustration, UI mockup, or abstract geometric.
3. **Accent blue (`#2D7FF9`) should appear in EVERY image but always sparingly** — as a single highlighted element, dot, or accent line. Never as a dominant color.
4. **Warm cream (`#F5F0EB`) or sand (`#E8E2DA`)** should be the dominant background tone for all light-mode images (sections 1–4).
5. **White (`#FFFFFF`)** is used for card/panel surfaces inside the illustrations — never as the background of the image itself.
6. **Rounded corners everywhere** — 10px for small elements, 14px for cards/panels, 20px for outer containers.
7. **Generous whitespace** inside each illustration. Don't fill every pixel — let the designs breathe.
8. **No text in images** unless it's abstract placeholder text (gray lines/blocks representing text). No readable words inside the illustrations.
9. **Consistent shadow style:** If using shadows, keep them soft, warm-toned (not pure black), and at very low opacity (5–10%).
10. **Export with transparent backgrounds** where possible, so they blend naturally into the cream website background.
