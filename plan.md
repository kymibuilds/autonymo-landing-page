# Autonymo Landing Page Clarity Overhaul — Plan

## The Core Problem

When someone lands on autonymo.com, they can't quickly answer: **"What does this company actually do, and do they solve MY problem?"**

The current site leads with generic AI/automation language ("AI solutions built for your industry," "Automation Agents," "Lead Qualification," "Data & Analytics") — language that could describe any of 1,000 AI agencies. The industry cards (Real Estate OS, Health Services OS, Custom Solutions) are below the fold with placeholder visuals and vague descriptions. Nothing on the page tells a visitor in 5 seconds: *"We build AI-powered operating systems that run your business — here's what that looks like for your industry."*

### What BenAI's SEO page gets right (and we don't)

BenAI's `/ai-seo-solutions` page works because:
1. **Tabbed feature showcase** — 5 tabs (Content Generation, Search Strategy, Publishing, Site Audits, Programmatic SEO) with a visual + description for each. You immediately understand the full product.
2. **Before/After comparison** — "Traditional SEO Agency" vs "AI SEO Agency in a Box" makes the value proposition visceral.
3. **Industry-specific proof** — Real case studies with graphs (SaaS, E-commerce, Local Business) organized by industry tab.
4. **Timeline** — "Ready in 7 Days. Yours Forever. Support Included." makes the process tangible.
5. **Industry grid** — "Search Optimization For Any Industry" with cards for E-Commerce, Local Business, SaaS.

We need similar mechanisms on our homepage to make what we do **instantly scannable and self-qualifying**.

## What We Offer (for content accuracy)

### Business Structure
1. **Consulting / Custom Solutions** — AI Operations Audits → custom AI system design & build → ongoing partnership. For any industry.
2. **Productized Solutions** (industry-specific AI Operating Systems):
   - **Real Estate OS** — Lead response, listing management, owner relationships, contract automation, visit management, marketing engine
   - **Health Services OS** — Patient reactivation, smart scheduling, patient communication, review management, insurance verification, clinical documentation
   - *(Future: Lead Generation OS — currently orphaned/unvalidated)*

### Key differentiator
We're not a generic AI agency. We build **complete AI operating systems** — integrated, multi-module platforms that run core business operations. Think of it as "your entire back-office automated and connected," not "a chatbot."

## Proposed Changes

### 1. NEW: "What We Build" Interactive Tabs Section (after hero, replaces AI Capabilities)

**Inspiration:** BenAI's tabbed feature showcase on `/ai-seo-solutions`

**Purpose:** Let visitors instantly see what Autonymo builds, organized by solution type, with a visual + short description for each.

**Implementation:** A horizontal tab bar with 3 tabs:
- **Real Estate OS**
- **Health Services OS**  
- **Custom Solutions**

Each tab reveals a card with:
- **Left side:** 3-4 key modules as a list with icons and one-line descriptions
- **Right side:** A visual/illustration/mockup showing the system in action

**Content for each tab:**

#### Tab 1: Real Estate OS
*Tagline under tab title:* "Everything a modern real estate agency needs to run on AI."

| Module | One-liner |
|--------|-----------|
| Lead Response Engine | Respond to portal leads in seconds via WhatsApp — not hours |
| Active Listing Management | Stale listing alerts, price monitoring, automated owner reports |
| Owner Relationship Engine | Re-engage past owners with market updates and nurture sequences |
| Contract Automation | Generate reserva, arras, and commission agreements in clicks |

*CTA:* "Explore Real Estate OS →"

#### Tab 2: Health Services OS
*Tagline:* "Purpose-built for clinics, dental practices, and wellness centers."

| Module | One-liner |
|--------|-----------|
| Smart Scheduling | AI-powered booking across practitioners — fill cancellation gaps automatically |
| Patient Reactivation | Automated outreach to dormant patients with personalized recall campaigns |
| Patient Communication Hub | Unified WhatsApp, email, and SMS — confirmations, follow-ups, and reviews |
| Insurance & Documentation | Automate eligibility checks, claims, and clinical note generation |

*CTA:* "Explore Health Services OS →"

#### Tab 3: Custom Solutions
*Tagline:* "Your business is unique. Your AI system should be too."

| Module | One-liner |
|--------|-----------|
| Workflow Automation | Map and automate any business process end-to-end |
| Custom AI Agents | Purpose-built agents trained on your data and business logic |
| System Integration | Connect CRMs, ERPs, databases, and legacy systems |
| Dashboards & Analytics | Real-time operational dashboards around your KPIs |

*CTA:* "Discuss Your Project →"

---

### 2. NEW: "Who It's For" Industry Grid Section (after tabs)

**Inspiration:** BenAI's "Search Optimization For Any Industry" section

**Purpose:** Let visitors self-identify by industry. Makes it immediately clear we serve specific verticals (not "everyone").

**Implementation:** Section with heading + 2-row grid of industry cards.

**Heading:** "AI Operating Systems For Your Industry"
**Subheading:** "We build complete AI systems tailored to how your industry actually works — not generic automation that needs months of customization."

**Cards (6 total, 3x2 grid):**

| Industry | Icon | Short description |
|----------|------|-------------------|
| Real Estate | Building2 | Automate lead response, listing management, and contracts for agencies and property managers. |
| Healthcare & Dental | Stethoscope | Smart scheduling, patient reactivation, and clinical documentation for modern practices. |
| Professional Services | Briefcase | Streamline client intake, document generation, and project workflows for law firms, accounting, and consultancies. |
| Industrial & Manufacturing | Factory | Production monitoring, supply chain automation, and quality control systems for Mittelstand and mid-market. |
| Agencies | Megaphone | Scale service delivery, automate reporting, and increase client capacity without hiring. |
| Other Industries | Puzzle | Don't see your industry? We run an AI audit and build exactly what you need. → Custom Solutions |

*Each card links to the relevant OS page, or to `/custom-solutions` for non-productized verticals.*

---

### 3. REVAMP: Hero Section — Sharper Positioning

**Current:** "AI solutions built for your industry." — Generic, could be any AI company.

**New headline options (pick one):**
- "We build the AI systems that run your business."
- "Your industry. Your workflows. One intelligent operating system."
- "AI operating systems for Real Estate, Healthcare, and beyond."

**New subtitle:**
"Autonymo designs, builds, and deploys complete AI platforms — not one-off tools — tailored to your industry's workflows. From automated lead response to contract generation, we replace manual operations with intelligent systems that work 24/7."

**Key change:** Add a small explainer strip below the CTA buttons — 3 inline micro-stats or value props:

| ✓ Live in weeks, not months | ✓ Works with your existing tools | ✓ Ongoing support included |

This immediately answers "how fast?" "do I need to change everything?" and "will you disappear after launch?"

---

### 4. REVAMP: Benefits Section → "Before & After" Comparison

**Inspiration:** BenAI's "SEO Has Changed. Your Agency Should Too." before/after section.

**Current:** 6 generic benefit cards (Speed, Control, Flexibility, etc.) with abstract descriptions and decorative micro-visuals. Doesn't tell the visitor anything concrete.

**New: "Before Autonymo / After Autonymo" split comparison**

**Heading:** "Your Operations Are About to Change."
**Subheading:** "Stop patching workflows with spreadsheets and manual follow-ups. Start running on an intelligent operating system."

| Before (Manual Operations) | After (Autonymo OS) |
|---|---|
| Leads sit for hours — prospects move on | AI responds to inquiries in seconds, 24/7 |
| Staff drowns in admin, data entry, follow-ups | Automated workflows handle the repetitive work |
| Scaling means hiring more people | Same team handles 3-5x more with AI |
| Information scattered across tools and inboxes | One unified system with real-time dashboards |
| Decisions based on gut, not data | AI surfaces insights and recommends actions |
| Every new process = months of setup | New capabilities deployed in days |

---

### 5. REVAMP: "How It Works" → Concrete Timeline

**Inspiration:** BenAI's "Ready in 7 Days. Yours Forever. Support Included."

**Current:** 3 generic steps (Discovery Call, Build & Integrate, Launch & Support) with abstract descriptions.

**New: Specific timeline with concrete deliverables**

**Heading:** "From First Call to Live System. Here's How."

| Step | Timeline | What happens |
|------|----------|--------------|
| Discovery & Audit | Week 1 | We map your workflows, tech stack, and pain points. You receive a prioritized AI implementation roadmap. |
| Build & Configure | Weeks 2-4 | We design and build your AI operating system, integrated with your existing tools (CRM, WhatsApp, email, etc.). |
| Launch & Train | Week 4-5 | Your system goes live. We train your team and optimize performance during a 30-day support window. |
| Ongoing Partnership | Month 2+ | Continuous optimization, new modules, and strategic AI guidance. We become your AI department. |

---

### 6. REMOVE: "AI Capabilities" Section (Automation Agents, Voice Agent, Lead Qualification, Data & Analytics)

**Why:** This section is the main source of confusion. It describes generic AI building blocks, not solutions. A real estate agent doesn't care about "Automation Agents" — they care about "Lead Response Engine." The new tabbed section (Change #1) replaces this by showing capabilities **in context of the industry they serve.**

**What happens to the content:**
- Automation Agents → folded into Custom Solutions tab
- AI Voice Agent → mentioned within Real Estate OS (lead response) and Health Services OS (patient communication)
- Lead Qualification → mentioned within Real Estate OS and Custom Solutions
- Data & Analytics → mentioned within all tabs as "dashboards & analytics"

---

### 7. REMOVE: "Powered by leading AI technologies" Logo Marquee

**Why:** The current marquee shows OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain, Mistral, Pinecone, etc. — these are tools we use, not clients who trust us. It reads like a tools page, not social proof. Visitors don't care which LLM framework we use.

**Replace with:** Actual client logos or a "Trusted by teams across Spain, Germany, and beyond" text badge (if client logos aren't available yet). Or remove entirely until we have real client logos.

---

### 8. NEW: Quick Explainer Strip (below hero, above tabs)

**Purpose:** A 1-line section that instantly answers "what is an AI Operating System?" for visitors who don't know.

**Implementation:** Full-width cream/sand strip with centered text:

> **What's an AI Operating System?** — It's a connected suite of AI-powered tools built for your industry: automated lead response, smart scheduling, document generation, real-time dashboards, and more — all working together, replacing manual processes across your entire operation.

*Small, centered, 14px text. Not a section — just a clarifying strip.*

---

### 9. ADD: Social Proof / Credibility Badges (keep simple for now)

**Since we may not have client logos yet, add a minimal trust strip:**

Implementation options:
- "Currently deployed in real estate agencies and healthcare practices across Catalonia and DACH"
- Or 3 stats: "X systems deployed · Y workflows automated · Z hours saved monthly"
- If client logos are available (ProApi, Cemav, etc.), use a small logo row

---

---

## Design Notes

- Maintain the existing warm/premium aesthetic (cream bg, sand borders, charcoal text, accent blue)
- Tabs should use the same `rounded-xl bg-white border border-sand` card style
- Before/After should use a split layout: left side in `bg-sand/20` (muted/old), right side in `bg-white` (clean/new)
- Industry grid cards should use subtle color-coded icon backgrounds (same as nav dropdown icons)
- All animations stay consistent with existing Framer Motion patterns (fade-up on scroll)
- Mobile: Tabs stack vertically as an accordion or swipeable carousel
